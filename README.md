## Placement Portal Backend 

Build with golang. 
Use docker to host the db. 

live backend: 
```
https://placement-portal-backend-z1yb.onrender.com/
```

This backend is deployed on render so, the server shuts down after inactivity. 
So it takes around 50 seconds to restart. 

So you can just hit the below endpoint in your browser to start the server.
